They can save you time and money on your beauty regimen, while providing you with that glamorous look you\u2019ve always dreamed of showing off to the world. At the same time, however, they can be a real challenge for women who are reluctant to adapt their makeup routine to accommodate their new lashes. We\u2019ve compiled a list of the worst makeup options for lash extensions, to help you ensure that your makeup routine is compatible with your new eyelash enhancements.<\/p>\n<h2>Why Does Your Makeup Choice Matter?<\/h2>\n<p>You may be wondering why you need to be concerned about your makeup? The answer is simple: you want your lash extensions to last as long as possible, and look their best \u2013 right? Well, to achieve those goals, you will need to change your makeup routine to eliminate anything that might pose a threat to your lash extension integrity. Failing to do so could result in unnecessary lash loss, or damage to the extensions.<\/p>\n<h2>Makeup You Should Eliminate<\/h2>\n<p>Let\u2019s start with the makeup options you need to eliminate from your beauty routine:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pencil eyeliner. You should stop using this beauty product so that you can avoid any stickiness on your lash line that might lead to lash tangling. When extensions get tangled, it can increase lash loss by weakening the adhesive bond. Fortunately, you won\u2019t need that old pencil liner to accent your new extensions!<\/li>\n<li>Waterproof Eyeliner and mascara. As a rule, if you need to rub your lashes to remove makeup, then you should probably look for an alternative. All that rubbing can weaken the lash extensions and cause them to fall out.<\/li>\n<li>Oil-based makeup remover. Many oil-based products can damage the adhesive that keeps your eyelash extensions attached to your natural lashes. Try an oil-free option instead.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The good news is that: 1) with your new lashes, you won\u2019t need as much makeup as you think; and 2) even if you want to continue to use these types of products, there are alternatives that won\u2019t pose a risk to your beautiful extensions. For instance, you can find light mascaras and eyeliners that won\u2019t add extra weight to your delicate extensions. You can opt for eyeliner powder or an eyeliner pen to avoid the stickiness that pencils can cause. You can even find makeup removers that won\u2019t harm your extensions.<\/p>\n<p>At Ebenezer Eyelash, we understand how important it is that your new lash extensions stay in place throughout your natural lash life cycle.
