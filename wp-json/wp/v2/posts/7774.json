It\u2019s quite another to make that feeling last for the life cycle of those natural lashes. Unfortunately, far too many women fail to properly care for and protect their lash extensions. Many experience unnecessary and preventable lash loss that can ruin their lash look and leave them wondering whether perfect lashes are sustainable. The good news is that there are steps you can take to protect your lash extensions.<\/p>\n<h2>Consider a Lighter Application<\/h2>\n<p>If you\u2019ve requested heavy extensions, don\u2019t be surprised to see some fall out in relatively short order. Always work with your technician to ensure that your natural lashes can handle whichever application you choose. Always choose lighter lashes and consider how that weight will impact your natural eyelashes.<\/p>\n<h2>Guard Against Oils<\/h2>\n<p>If you\u2019re used to using oil-based creams around your eyes, you might want to consider other options \u2013 or take great care while wearing lash extensions. Those oils could weaken the adhesive that binds your extensions to your natural lashes \u2013 and that could be disastrous for your perfect lashes.<\/p>\n<h2>Don\u2019t Sleep on Your Face<\/h2>\n<p>This one is so simple \u2013 and yet so difficult for some people to manage. Sleeping on your face is an almost sure-fire way to destroy your lash extensions, and virtually guaranteed to result in several extensions on your pillowcase the morning after. Try to learn to sleep on your back.<\/p>\n<h2>Don\u2019t Use Waterproof Mascara<\/h2>\n<p>Look, you won\u2019t really need mascara once you have extensions, but we understand that you may still want that extra dramatic appeal. If you do wear mascara with your extensions, do not use the waterproof variety. You\u2019ll struggle to remove it and could damage your extensions in the process.<\/p>\n<h2>Avoid Steam and Excessive Heat<\/h2>\n<p>While you must wash and brush your extensions each day, you should make sure to avoid high temperatures and steam. Those elements could potentially break down your adhesive and cause lash loss.<\/p>\n<h2>Hands Off the Merchandise!<\/h2>\n<p>Watch where you put your hands. Many women get into the habit of tugging on lashes, twirling them, gently twisting them, and so on. When you\u2019re wearing lash extensions, it is vital to avoid those habits and keep your hands away from the lashes. Even gentle tugging could result in weaker bonds and lost lashes. As a rule, you should just get in the habit of leaving your lashes alone.<\/p>\n<p>Fortunately, proper lash extension protection is not as complex as it might seem at first glance. Most of the things you need to do to get the most out of your lash extensions require very little conscious effort. Many are basically common-sense lash care habits that you should already be practicing anyway. Just remember that feeling you enjoyed when you looked into the mirror right after getting your new extensions and imagine how great you\u2019ll feel knowing that you look that good every single day. That should be incentive enough to help inspire you to follow through on your lash protection program.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It\u2019s one thing to get a new set of lash extensions and feel that rush of excitement when you see how great your lashes look.
