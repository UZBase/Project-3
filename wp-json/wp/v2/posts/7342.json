The fact is that millions of women wear lash extensions on a continual basis, and have adopted them as part of their daily appearance. That\u2019s an option that almost any woman can enjoy, but it does require some basic knowledge about care and lifestyle choices. If you\u2019re considering lash extensions as a more permanent feature of your beauty enhancement regimen, it\u2019s important to know about these tips for living with them on a full-time basis.<\/p>\n<h2>Only Use the Best Materials and Applications<\/h2>\n<p>Don\u2019t settle for inexperienced technicians, haphazard application processes, or inferior lashes. It\u2019s much easier to adapt to lash extensions when you\u2019re relying on quality lash products that have been properly applied by qualified, licensed professionals. If you\u2019re going to make lash extensions a part of your life, make sure that your extensions are done the right way!<\/p>\n<h2>Leave the Mascara Alone<\/h2>\n<p>This is a difficult thing for many women to do, but it\u2019s important. Your lash extensions don\u2019t need mascara, since they\u2019re full, lush, and gorgeously dark on their own. You don\u2019t need mascara to make them look great, and applying it can actually do more harm than good.<\/p>\n<h2>Keep Your Fingers Out of Your Eyes!<\/h2>\n<p>Yes, you want to touch your lashes. You want to touch your eyes. Don\u2019t. Leave your fingers away from your eyes, and try to avoid rubbing them or pulling on the extensions. Excessive contact of that nature can deposit debris on the lashes, and you can weaken the adhesive bond that holds them in place. The only time you should be touching your extensions is when you\u2019re cleaning them.<\/p>\n<h2>Keep Your Lashes Clean<\/h2>\n<p>And while we\u2019re on the subject of cleaning those extensions, let\u2019s make sure that you do it the right way. As a rule, you should cleanse your lash extensions at least once a day. Use a gentle rinse \u2013 with diluted baby shampoo or other mild cleansers \u2013 and gently rub the cleanser over the length of the lashes. Rinse them, and you\u2019re done. Again, don\u2019t pull on them, rub harshly, or otherwise create stress for the extensions.<\/p>\n<h2>Avoid Lying on Them<\/h2>\n<p>You should also make some adjustments to your sleep routine, if possible. If you sleep on your extensions, they\u2019ll tend to bend just like your hair does in that situation. If that happens, you\u2019ll need to wet them and reshape them. You can avoid that by sleeping on your back, or taking other steps to ensure that you\u2019re not lying on them while you\u2019re asleep.<\/p>\n<p>The fact is that lash extensions can be a great addition to your life, but you do need to adapt certain aspects of your lifestyle to accommodate these beauty enhancements.
