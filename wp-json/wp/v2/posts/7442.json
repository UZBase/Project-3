Well, one thing is certain: you\u2019re not alone! Millions of women are facing the same challenge and frustrations that you experience every day. And like you, many of them turn to proven beauty enhancement techniques like lash lifts and tints to mask their lash deficiencies. But what if we told you that there was a better way to beat those limp lashes into shape? As it turns out, there is a better option: lash extensions!<\/p>\n<h2>Lash Extensions vs the Lash Lift<\/h2>\n<p>Lash lifts and lash extensions share one thing in common: they\u2019re both designed to give you the appearance of fuller, perfectly-curled lashes. There\u2019s a major difference between these two solutions, however, and that difference can make all the difference in the world when it comes to how you look and feel. You, see, lash lifts use various products to make your lashes look longer, better-curled, and fuller. Eyelash extensions add real length and fullness to your lashes. In other words, one creates the illusion of fullness, while the other actually adds volume to those lashes.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, they both share many things in common as well. For example, the lash lift and lash extension application process can each take over an hour. They also have a similar life expectancy, with extensions lasting for around two months, and the lash lift for two to three months. Both require ongoing maintenance to ensure that you keep your lashes in perfect condition, with the volume and curl that you desire.<\/p>\n<h2>Extensions are the Better Choice<\/h2>\n<p>At the end of the day, though, the eyelash extension option is superior in all the ways that matter. For while the lash lift can give you the appearance of fuller lashes, it\u2019s just an illusion. It\u2019s a special effect, similar to what you can achieve with mascara and other eye makeup products. To get truly fuller lashes that provide that dazzling glam look that every woman deserves, you need to rely on eyelash extensions to do the job.<\/p>\n<p>A professionally-applied set of eyelash extensions will add real length to your lashes, and the type of volume that you cannot achieve with makeup techniques, lash lifts, tinting, or other tools and tricks of the trade. Your new set of lash extensions will leave your lashes fuller than you ever thought possible, with perfect curls and length that will be the envy of all your friends and neighbors.<\/p>\n<p>At Ebenezer Eyelash, we believe that there is no substitute for properly-applied eyelash extensions when it comes to enhancing the beauty of any woman\u2019s eyes.
