Some lash-wearers still faithfully apply mascara on a regular basis, unable to set aside that old habit. Often, that constant application and removal of eye makeup ends up preventing them from fully enjoying their natural-looking extensions. In some instances, those extension-wearers even find that their new lashes don\u2019t last as long as they should due to that continual reliance on mascara. The problem is that many of them simply don\u2019t realize that they no longer need that makeup to give the illusion of perfect lashes; their extensions already provide the real thing!<\/p>\n<p>Still, we understand how difficult it can be to fully transition from mascara to lash extensions. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve compiled some of the most important facts you need to know to help you commit to a mascara-free life. Once you\u2019ve seen the real benefits your extensions provide, you\u2019ll appreciate just how unnecessary that mascara really is.<\/p>\n<h2>Handling those Extensions<\/h2>\n<p>First, let\u2019s clear something up: your new lash extensions are not designed to be continually handled. Sure, you need to gently clean them every day, to keep them free of debris and bacteria. However, you don\u2019t want to touch them any more than necessary \u2013 and that includes applying mascara. Every woman understands just how much attention mascara demands during application. Often, women have to apply several layers of mascara to achieve their desired look. But whether it\u2019s one layer or three, one simple truth remains constant: whatever you put on your lashes eventually needs to be removed.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, that mascara-removal process requires you to touch, dab at, and otherwise handle your lashes. For extension-wearers, all that activity just increases the odds that you\u2019ll weaken the adhesive bond and damage the lash. To avoid that, think twice before you reach for that mascara.<\/p>\n<h2>You Don\u2019t Need Mascara Anyway<\/h2>\n<p>The other reason to set aside that mascara and trust your new extensions is even simpler to understand; you don\u2019t need mascara when you have lash extensions. Remember, a great set of eyelash extensions gives you that extra length, volume, and curl that you\u2019ve always tried to achieve with mascara and other lash enhancement techniques. If the goal is perfect lashes, then extensions are the solution you\u2019ve been looking for. What can mascara really add to perfection? That\u2019s right: nothing.<\/p>\n<p>The bottom line is clear: eyelash extensions are your key to getting the perfect lashes of your dreams. Mascara and other eye makeup are simply unnecessary, since those extensions give you all the very real benefits you try to mimic with makeup. And since mascara can actually pose a risk to those extensions due to excessive handling of the lashes and potential weakening of the adhesive bond, they should be avoided whenever possible. Trust your extensions to give you that perfect lash look you deserve.
