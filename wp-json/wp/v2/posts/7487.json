Of course, things are never quite that simple. While it is possible that some women may be able to successfully apply their own lash extensions, most experts recommend that women avoid that option altogether. In fact, there are several very good reasons why DIY eyelash extensions are never really your best option.<\/p>\n<h2>Steady Hands and Observant Eyes<\/h2>\n<p>You might figure that you\u2019ll have no trouble applying those lashes on your own, but have you thought about what that really means? You will need to carefully attach each extension to an individual lash, with one eye closed. If your hand wavers, or your depth perception fails you, you could easily glue the lash to multiple lashes, or even your eyelid. Without a deft touch and a practiced eye, you may find that you simply create clumps of lashes rather than that beautiful, individual lash application you\u2019re seeking.<\/p>\n<h2>It\u2019s All About the Adhesive<\/h2>\n<p>Speaking of that adhesive, have you checked out these products lately? Lash technicians use strong adhesives to ensure that your extensions stay in place for the life of the lash. Are you truly comfortable with the idea of applying a powerful glue to your eyelashes \u2013 in close proximity to your skin and eye? Frankly, you shouldn\u2019t be. These adhesives need to be handled with care, which makes a do-it-yourself approach the least effective option for proper application.<\/p>\n<h2>Training and Licensing Matters<\/h2>\n<p>Experts always recommend that customers rely on technicians who have the right kind of training, and who are properly licensed by their states.\u00a0 If you think about it, there\u2019s probably a reason for that recommendation. Lash technicians are trained to evaluate your lashes and select the right lash length and weight for your individual needs. Choosing the wrong lashes can result in excess stress on your natural eyelashes, and premature shedding.<\/p>\n<p>Licensing is also important, since it ensures that technicians have received the approval of state authorities. That\u2019s designed to protect clients from untrained and less-competent technicians, and ensure the best results. How likely is it that you can apply your own lashes with the level of expertise you\u2019ll receive from a professionally-trained and state-sanctioned technician? Sometimes, credentials like that really do matter.<\/p>\n<p>In short, there are many reasons to avoid the DIY option for your eyelash extension needs.
