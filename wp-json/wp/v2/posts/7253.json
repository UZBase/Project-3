Many women see the results on their friends, and can\u2019t help but be intrigued by the prospect of enhancing their own natural beauty with perfect lashes. You may even have planned to rush out and have an extension application, only to later hesitate out of a desire to learn more about these beauty wonders. That\u2019s a natural thing to do, of course, and you should be educated before you make any decision like this. In fact, there are five specific things that you should consider before you get eyelash extensions.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>They\u2019re not a short-term commitment. Unlike temporary falsies, these extensions have a longer lifespan. Typically, they\u2019ll last as long as your natural lashes, which means that you can expect them to endure for anywhere from six weeks to two months \u2013 the natural life cycle of the average eyelash. That means that you need to be prepared to have them with you for the long haul.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>You\u2019ll need a day of relative relaxation after your extensions. Your application needs time to set, to ensure that the adhesive holds properly. That means that you\u2019ll need a day without showering, swimming, or washing your face. You should also avoid saunas, excessive outdoor activity \u2013 especially in the heat, and crying. Your best option is to make sure that you have a day of rest scheduled for the day after your application.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>There is maintenance involved. Lash extensions are not something you just get and then ignore. You need to cleanse them daily, and avoid lying on them when you\u2019re asleep. For best results, you should also consider fill-in sessions between full applications, since lashes don\u2019t necessarily all fall out at once.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>Your extensions will probably change your makeup routine. Once you get lash extensions, mascara may not be the only makeup that you set aside. Many women discover that they no longer need eyeliner, and many others find that they can limit their application of other makeup products too. It\u2019s amazing what a powerful set of lashes can do.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>You\u2019ll never look at your natural lashes the same way again. One thing\u2019s for sure: once you see yourself with extensions, your natural lashes will always seem shorter, less full, and less vibrant than your beauty enhancements. That\u2019s how great your extensions will make your lashes look!<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>It\u2019s always important to understand what you\u2019re getting into when you make a big change like eyelash extensions.
