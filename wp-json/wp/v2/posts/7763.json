While they are one of the easiest and best ways to provide women with the perfect lashes they crave, these extensions are anything but maintenance-free. In fact, there are certain things that the women who wear them will need to do each day to ensure that they get the most out of their investment. At or near the top of that list is daily lash brushings. Yes, that\u2019s right: you need to brush your lash extensions if you want to keep them in the best shape possible.<\/p>\n<h2>When Lashes Go Wild\u2026<\/h2>\n<p>Lash brushings are important to help make your lashes last. Unfortunately, our busy lifestyles often place those lashes in situations that can leave them tangled, bent, crossed over one another, or bunched together. If you\u2019ve ever had clumped mascara affect your lashes in any of those ways, then you know how irritating and frustrating those problems can be. By brushing them daily, you can help to avoid those challenges and better protect those extensions for the life of your lashes.<\/p>\n<p>Now, you may wonder how your lashes could even have these difficulties \u2013 especially if you\u2019ve opted to forgo mascara while you\u2019re wearing extensions. The problem is that lashes accumulate oil, water, dust, and debris throughout each day, and those substances can eventually cause the lashes to clump together, crisscross, or otherwise become unmanageable. Moreover, many women roll onto their lashes at different times during the sleep cycle, which can cause them to bend or intertwine. That needs to be addressed if you want your lashes to last and look their best.<\/p>\n<h2>How to Brush Your Lashes<\/h2>\n<p>The good news is that there is nothing complicated about brushing your lashes and extensions. And since it is such an easy process, you should commit to brushing them when you wake up in the morning, as well as any time they make contact with water. Simply follow these tips to brush them and keep them at their best<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Remember to be gentle with your lashes, to avoid pulling or tugging them.<\/li>\n<li>Use a good lash styling wand.<\/li>\n<li>Avoid brushing at the point of attachment, so that you don\u2019t inadvertently weaken the adhesive bond or pull the extensions loose.<\/li>\n<li>Brush in a motion that follows the natural curl of the extension.<\/li>\n<li>Each brushing session should take no more than 30 seconds to complete.<\/li>\n<li>If you wear mascara or other eye makeup, keep your lash wand on hand In case you need to touch up your brushing throughout the day.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Maintaining your<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ebenezereyelash.com\/eyelash-extension-services\/\"> eyelash extensions<\/a> is really not that difficult once we understand what they need to look their best. By focusing on daily lash brushing, you can keep lashes looking their natural best, avoid unwelcome clumping and tangling, and keep them healthy and intact for the duration of your lash growth cycle.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Eyelash extensions have been widely heralded as a truly great beauty enhancement, but they are not without their challenges.
