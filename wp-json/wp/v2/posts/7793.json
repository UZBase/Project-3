Some simply want longer eyelashes. Others want increased curl, especially if their natural lashes are limp and lifeless. Still others want to compensate for their thin lashes by getting extensions that increase thickness and volume. What many women may not realize, however, is that there are usually limits to what can be achieved. That\u2019s why lash artists work so hard to assess your natural lashes and recommend the right application for your needs \u2013 especially when it comes to lash thickness.<\/p>\n<h2>Extensions Should Be Chosen Based on Natural Lash Strength<\/h2>\n<p>Ideally, we would each be free to choose the thickest possible extensions to accentuate our natural lashes. The problem is that the real world is anything but ideal. While most women would love to sport really thick lashes, they just can\u2019t do it \u2013 and for a very good reason: your natural lashes have to be able to support the full weight of any extensions glued to them. Which leads us to the next thing you need to know:<\/p>\n<h2>\u2026 Excessively Thick Extensions Could Damage Your Natural Lashes<\/h2>\n<p>In fact, many of the women who have suffered damage to their natural lashes as a result of extensions experienced those ill effects only because they chose the wrong extensions. Yes, thicker lashes are more dramatic and easily create that added volume we all craze. But when that aesthetic benefit comes at the expense of lash safety, it is obviously not worth the risk.<\/p>\n<p>Remember, every single extension is individually glued to one of your natural lashes. That means that each of your natural lashes needs to be able to support the weight and length of that extension. If your natural lashes are not up to that challenge, it can result in lash shedding or braking. Obviously, your goal should be to preserve your natural lashes and extensions for the natural life of those lashes. You cannot accomplish that if your extension choice damages those lashes.<\/p>\n<h2>There Is a Rule of Thumb for Selecting Thickness<\/h2>\n<p>The good news is that you can take much of the guesswork out of choosing your extension types. As a rule, you should:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Choose extensions that are longer than your natural lashes \u2013 but only slightly longer. Remember, that added length also adds weight<\/li>\n<li>Select extensions that are just a little bit thicker than the ones you were born with.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>A great lash artist can still achieve magic for you, and ensure that you get the longer, thicker, beautifully curved lashes you deserve. If you have weak lashes, however, you shouldn\u2019t opt for those thicker extensions that could place your lash health at risk.<\/p>\n<p>The bottom line is simple: there are limits to just how thick your extensions can be. Still, that doesn\u2019t mean that there are limitations to just how great your lashes can look. With the right application and the best eyelash extensions in New York City, you can still enjoy dazzlingly perfect lashes that will draw the right kind of attention everywhere you go.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Women want many different things when it comes to lash extensions.
