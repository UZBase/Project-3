And maybe you\u2019ve been thinking about trying them yourself, since they look so great on your friends. If so, just know that there are some important aftercare tips that you\u2019ll need to remember. They cover several different areas of concern, but one of the most important has to do with your shadow habits. Here\u2019s what you need to know when you\u2019re showering with lash extensions.<\/p>\n<h2>\nAvoid Showering for at Least a Day<\/h2>\n<p>This is basic lash extension aftercare, but some women forget to heed its sage counsel. It is vital to remember that your extensions are glued to your natural lashes, using an adhesive. Like any adhesive, however, your lash glue will need time to properly set and bond with the supporting lashes. If you expose them to water, heat, steam, or other environmental factors, you could break down that adhesive and prevent it from forming a lasting bond.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, this is one of the main reasons why some women experience unusual lash shedding within the first twenty-four hours after an application. That first day is critical, so don\u2019t neglect those aftercare concerns. The last thing you want is to see your gorgeous lashes fall out because you forgot to wait before taking a shower!<\/p>\n<h2>\nHands Off!<\/h2>\n<p>I\u2019ve always had a habit of rubbing my eyes in the shower. Sometimes, it\u2019s just to remove some of the water that settles around the eyes as I\u2019m standing under the shower head. At other times, it happens as I\u2019m rinsing shampoo or conditioner out of my hair or rinsing away soap. This is a habit that I\u2019ve tried hard to break in recent years, and it\u2019s all due to a new understanding about how damaging that rub can be to my extensions.<\/p>\n<p>You see, when you rub your eyes, you\u2019re rubbing your lashes. And when you\u2019re wearing lash extensions, that rubbing can bend them, pull at the adhesive, or even cause them to come loose and fall off. That last one is the worst-case scenario, of course, but it\u2019s anything but uncommon. The good news is that there is a way to avoid it: stop rubbing your eyes in the shower. For that matter, stop rubbing them altogether. Your extensions will thank you for it.<\/p>\n<p>Aside from aftercare needs and a determined effort to avoid habits that can harm your extensions, your shower ritual can probably proceed as usual.<\/p>\n<p>At Ebenezer Eyelash, we know how important knowledge is when it comes to getting the most out of your lash extensions.
