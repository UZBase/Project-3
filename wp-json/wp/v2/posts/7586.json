And let\u2019s face it: it\u2019s only natural to be confused when you consider the different contradictory messages we hear every day. Some say that you should avoid water like the plague. Others suggest that water poses no real risk to your lash extensions. As usual, the truth is somewhere between those two extremes.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019ll call it the Goldilocks Effect, since \u2013 like that little girl in the well-known children\u2019s story \u2013 there is a happy medium where your lashes\u2019 interaction with water will be \u201cjust right.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>First, let\u2019s look at the extremes. At the first extreme, we have the \u201cno water\u201d argument. This is a valid point, of course, but it has only limited application for extension wearers. You see, it is true that you should avoid water for the first twenty-four hours after your lash extension application, to give the adhesive time to set properly. That means no showering, no steam, no facial washes, no swimming \u2013 no water.<\/p>\n<p>At the other extreme, we have those who might think that they can expose their extensions to as much moisture as they want after that initial adhesive-setting phase has passed. As you might expect, that extreme is usually wrong as well. Too much water \u2013 and especially hot water \u2013 can break down the adhesive over time. In addition, some types of water, like the chlorinated water you find in the average pool, can have a seriously negative impact on your extensions.<\/p>\n<p>So, what\u2019s the solution, if neither extreme is right? The answer is simple: take the same approach Goldilocks took when she was trying out the accommodations at the Three Bears\u2019 house and find that middle ground that\u2019s just right for your needs.<\/p>\n<p>Make no mistake; your eyelashes will need some water each day, to cleanse away dirt, debris, and any makeup that you might choose to wear. Just as important, that cleaning will help to ensure that you get rid of bacteria that can cause infection. To protect your eyes and your lashes, you should use a mild cleanser and gently clean those lashes daily, washing away the dirt and grime. Follow that up by gently brushing through the lashes to remove any remaining debris and moisture.<\/p>\n<p>The fact is that many common lash extension problems are caused by improper care. If you can avoid excessive amounts of moisture without neglecting that important daily cleansing, you can also avoid most instances of irritation and infection \u2013 which can help you to better appreciate your lash extension experience.<\/p>\n<p>At Ebenezer Eyelash, we know how important it is for our customers to receive the facts they need to better understand their new lives with lash extensions.
