You proudly showed them off to friends and family and enjoyed a glamorous night out on the town days later. You were the belle of the ball and the center of attention, and you loved every minute of it. You\u2019re hooked \u2013 but there\u2019s still that little voice in the back of your mind: what if they all fall out tomorrow? Yes, we\u2019re talking about lash shedding! What causes it, and how can you prevent it from happening?<\/p>\n<h2>Lash Shedding Causes<\/h2>\n<p>First, let\u2019s be absolutely clear: lashes fall out. They just do. In fact, every single lash you have will fall out within a few months, with new lashes growing in to replace the ones you lose. It\u2019s a natural phenomenon and one that you cannot prevent. So, we should clarify that right off the bat, so that you know what to expect. Anywhere from one to three or four lashes will drop out daily. So don\u2019t panic when that happens.<\/p>\n<p>On the other hand, if you see many lashes falling out \u2013 or wake up with several lashes on your pillow \u2013 it may be wise to take a look at your lifestyle and habits to see if there is anything that could be causing that excess lash loss. For example:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Are you using mascara? Some mascaras can actually destroy the adhesive bond and weaken the lash. You don\u2019t need mascara, so it\u2019s safer to just skip it altogether.<\/li>\n<li>Oil is bad for your extensions\u2019 connection to the natural lash too. If you\u2019re using oily skin products, that could be causing a weakening of that bond.<\/li>\n<li>Do you pull on your lashes, rub your eyes, or spend a lot of time touching your extensions? Keep your hands away from your eyes, except when you\u2019re cleaning the lashes.<\/li>\n<li>Sleeping on your face can cause undue stress on the extensions too.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Correcting the Problem<\/h2>\n<p>Once you understand what could be causing your lash loss, the solution is typically easy to find. Just stop doing whatever it is that you\u2019re doing. Don\u2019t use mascara, or oil-based products. Leave your lashes alone and don\u2019t tug on them or abuse them. And don\u2019t sleep face-down or in any position where your lashes are pulled, squished, or otherwise distorted. Finally, clean them daily to prevent oil-build up that can destroy that adhesive bond.<\/p>\n<p>At Ebenezer Eyelash, we\u2019re proud to provide the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ebenezereyelash.com\/eyelash-extension-services\/\">best lash extensions in New York City<\/a> to our clients in the area.
