For most women, extensions are the best option for maintaining perfect lashes without the hassle associated with mascara and eyelash curlers. But what about women with active lifestyles who might be worried about whether lash extensions can keep up with them as they go about their busy day? As it turns out, lash extensions are tough enough to withstand almost any activity!<\/p>\n<h2>Joggers, Hikers, and Marathon Runners<\/h2>\n<p>Millions of us jog, hike, or engage in grueling activities like marathons. Obviously, that\u2019s sweat-inducing business, so it\u2019s only natural to wonder whether the dampness will negatively impact your extensions. After all, the last thing you want to do is pay good money for extensions and ruin them, right? And you\u2019ve probably heard that lash extensions aren\u2019t supposed to get wet, so your concerns are certainly legitimate.<\/p>\n<p>The reality is, though, that you can get your lashes wet. In fact, you should get them wet daily, and gently cleanse them with a mild cleaner to remove dirt, oil, and debris. Otherwise, you\u2019ll risk irritation or infection. With that in mind, you\u2019ll be thrilled to learn that your extensions can easily withstand your running and jogging. Just be sure to clean the sweat and oil away when you\u2019re done!<\/p>\n<h2>Are You a Swimmer?<\/h2>\n<p>A lot of people swim regularly. It\u2019s great exercise, and an easy way to relax and unwind from a stressful day. If you\u2019re planning on getting extensions, though, there are a few things you need to know:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Swimming in fresh or salt water will not harm your extensions. Just rinse the salt or any debris when you\u2019re done, and your lashes should be perfectly fine.<\/li>\n<li>Swimming in chlorine can be another matter entirely, since chlorine can irritate the eyes and prompt you to rub them. If you\u2019re swimming in a pool, try goggles.<\/li>\n<li>Still not sure? Well, you can always wear goggles in any watery environment and remove all doubt.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>At the Gym, At Work, and Everywhere<\/h2>\n<p>Are you an avid gym-goer? Your extensions can keep up with you during those tough workouts too! Spend a lot of your workday on the go? Lash extensions will be your reliable companion throughout even the busiest day. The bottom line is simple: professionally-applied lash extensions are not just glam for those special occasions, but beauty enhancements that are tough enough to keep pace with even the most active lifestyle.<\/p>\n<p>At Ebenezer Eyelash, we understand how important it is for your lashes to keep pace with your daily activities.
