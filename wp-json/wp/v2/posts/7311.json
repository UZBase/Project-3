While there\u2019s a lot of great information to be found on many websites, there\u2019s also no shortage of myths and misconceptions floating around in cyberspace. These perceptions can often become commonly-held beliefs in short order, so it\u2019s important for people to have the facts to alleviate any unnecessary concerns. Here are five common concerns about extensions that just aren\u2019t worth the worry.<\/p>\n<h2>1. They Make Your Lashes Fall Out<\/h2>\n<p>There\u2019s no need to worry about extensions making your lashes fall out, because it doesn\u2019t happen. The reality is that some women just notice their natural lash shedding more because the extensions make those short lashes more noticeable when they drop.<\/p>\n<h2>2. They Stop Your Lashes from Growing<\/h2>\n<p>This is just an illusion, of course. Your lashes grow back when they fall out; they\u2019re just harder to notice due to the longer extensions around them. Remember, there are \u201cfill-in\u201d applications used to maintain a set of extensions as lashes fall out over time, and those wouldn\u2019t work if those missing lashes didn\u2019t grow back!<\/p>\n<h2>3. They Thin Out Your Natural Lashes<\/h2>\n<p>This too is an illusion. As you become accustomed to longer, thicker lashes, your natural lashes seem thinner than they did before. In reality, nothing about them has changed. That perception is simply the mind\u2019s way of making sense of what it sees. If you stopped wearing extensions for several months, your mind would once again see your natural lashes as normal.<\/p>\n<h2>4. The Application Process is Painful<\/h2>\n<p>No one who has ever had a proper lash extension application has ever experienced pain of the sort that some people seem to fear. In fact, these applications are generally so painless that clients can actually fall asleep during that hour or more that they\u2019re receiving their extensions. Remember, this is not something that involves pulling lashes out or applying adhesive to skin. It\u2019s just gluing extensions on, one-by-one, to individual lashes. No pain at all!<\/p>\n<h2>5. You Need to Rest Your Natural Lashes Before Getting New Extensions<\/h2>\n<p>This is another one of those myths that has no basis in reality. Your lash has a natural growth cycle that won\u2019t be interrupted by extensions even if you wear them almost continually. The key is to work with professionals who understand that you can\u2019t apply extensions to immature lashes. When applied properly, you shouldn\u2019t need to worry about \u201cresting\u201d your lashes.<\/p>\n<p>At Ebenezer Eyelash, we\u2019re committed to ensuring that our clients in the area always have the information they need to make sound decisions about their eyelash extension options.
