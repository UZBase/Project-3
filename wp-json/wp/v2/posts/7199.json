These concerns are nothing new, of course, and have prompted a variety of different cosmetic trends throughout human history. It seems women \u2013 and some men \u2013 have always been searching for the perfect lash look. In recent years, that quest has focused on treatments like eyelash extensions, which offer women an opportunity to enhance their natural lashes. For some women, however, concerns about possible damage to their natural eyelashes have prevented them from experimenting with these lash treatments. So, what\u2019s the verdict? Can extensions ruin your natural eyelashes?<\/p>\n<h2>A Mixed Assessment<\/h2>\n<p>There are some inherent difficulties when it comes to answering that type of question, largely because experiences have been so different for so many people. For millions of women, the application of lash extensions has resulted in the perfect, gorgeous lashes that they were looking for \u2013 without any side effects, discomfort, or real damage to those natural lashes. Meanwhile, other women have reported lash weakness and loss, or other similar complications. How can both types of result be true?<\/p>\n<p>One thing is obvious: if most eyelash treatments cause no problems for the women who receive them, then it is clear that there is no inherent danger to the natural lash. That doesn\u2019t explain the exceptions to that rule, however. Most experts believe that lash problems are in almost every instance the result of the type of application used to apply them. In other words, if you know someone whose natural lashes were damaged in any way by extensions, then the problem lies with the salon that did the application.<\/p>\n<h2>What the Best Salons Do Differently<\/h2>\n<p>It is important to recognize that poor lash extension jobs do not always indicate that the technician did a poor job. Sometimes, the problem is as simple as the type of adhesive used to affix each extension to that natural lash. Other times, the salon\u2019s application technique is the problem. Even good technicians can have bad results when they\u2019re working with inferior adhesives or are hamstrung by ineffective application techniques.<\/p>\n<p>A truly professional salon avoids those problems by using only the best and safest adhesives in an application process designed to achieve the highest possible level of quality. Adhesives are applied with the utmost care to ensure that each extension is glued to only one lash, while avoiding direct contact with the skin. When done properly, there should never be any unexpected lash damage, including unnatural lash loss.<\/p>\n<p>At <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ebenezereyelash.com\/\">Ebenezer Eyelash<\/a>, we take pride in ensuring that every eyelash extension we perform strictly adheres to the high standards we\u2019ve set for ourselves and our clientele.
