It\n        is Ebenezer Eyelash Extension's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect\n        while operating our websites.<\/p>\n    <h3>Website Visitors<\/h3>\n    <p>Like most website operators, Ebenezer Eyelash Extension collects non-personally-identifying information of the\n        sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference,\n        referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Ebenezer Eyelash Extension's purpose in\n        collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand\n        how Ebenezer Eyelash Extension's visitors use its website. From time to\n        time, Ebenezer Eyelash Extension may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by\n        publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.<\/p>\n    <p>Ebenezer Eyelash Extension also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol\n        (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on ebenezereyelash.com        blogs\/sites. Ebenezer Eyelash Extension only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same\n        circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that\n        commenter IP addresses and email addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog\/site\n        where the comment was left.<\/p>\n    <h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information<\/h3>\n    <p>Certain visitors to Ebenezer Eyelash Extension's websites choose to interact\n        with Ebenezer Eyelash Extension in ways that require Ebenezer Eyelash Extension to gather\n        personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Ebenezer Eyelash Extension gathers\n        depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up at <a\n                href=\"http:\/\/www.ebenezereyelash.com\">ebenezereyelash.com<\/a> to provide a\n        username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with Ebenezer Eyelash Extension are asked to\n        provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to\n        process those transactions. In each case, Ebenezer Eyelash Extension collects such information only insofar as\n        is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with\n\t\tEbenezer Eyelash Extension. Ebenezer Eyelash Extension does not disclose personally-identifying information\n        other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with\n        the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.<\/p>\n    <h3>Aggregated Statistics<\/h3>\n    <p>Ebenezer Eyelash Extension may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its\n        websites.

Some\n        of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by\n        using Ebenezer Eyelash Extension's websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to\n        them. Ebenezer Eyelash Extension will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and\n        personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated\n        organizations, as described above, Ebenezer Eyelash Extension discloses potentially personally-identifying and\n        personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or\n        when Ebenezer Eyelash Extension believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the\n        property or rights of Ebenezer Eyelash Extension, third parties or the public at large.

Ebenezer Eyelash Extension takes all\n        measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of\n        potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.<\/p>\n    <h3>Cookies<\/h3>\n    <p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser\n        provides to the website each time the visitor returns.

You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that\n        any acquirer of Ebenezer Eyelash Extension may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this\n        policy.<\/p>\n    <h3>Ads<\/h3>\n    <p>Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies.\n        These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to\n        compile information about you or others who use your computer.
