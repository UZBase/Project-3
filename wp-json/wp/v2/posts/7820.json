Many of them wonder whether they need to have their extensions removed after a certain amount of time, or whether they should just wait for the lash growth cycle to complete and then schedule another appointment. For most women, however, there is no need to choose any of those options. Thanks to eyelash extension refills, it is possible to maintain perfect lashes year-round. In fact, most regular eyelash wearers understand that those refills are critically important for ensuring that their lashes always look their best.<\/p>\n<h2>What is The Lash Lifecycle?<\/h2>\n<p>To understand why refills are so important, it\u2019s vital to recognize how the lash lifecycle works. Like other hair on your head and body, your lashes grow, fall out, and get replaced by new follicles over time. Eyelashes are each programmed to grow to a certain length before they are shed to make way for new hair growth. That growth stage can last for weeks, followed by a transition and resting phase before new growth starts. Of course, the exact duration of that cycle varies from person to person.<\/p>\n<p>Throughout this entire process, it\u2019s common for several lashes to fall out each day. That happens because different lashes are always at different stages of the lifecycle. Obviously, if they all started growing at the same time, achieved maximum growth simultaneously, and then fell out together, we would all be lashless at different points throughout the year. Thankfully, those lashes stagger that growth and shedding process to prevent that from happening.<\/p>\n<h2>How Refills Work<\/h2>\n<p>The beauty of lash extensions is that you don\u2019t have to wait for all your lashes to fall out and regrow to get a new set of perfect lashes. In fact, you more than likely won\u2019t even want to consider that option. After all, that would mean going through several weeks of irregular lash length, with some lashes retaining their extensions and some newer lashes without them. That\u2019s a far cry from the perfect lashes you had in mind when you chose lash extensions.<\/p>\n<p>The good news is that you can avoid that asymmetrical, less-than-perfect appearance by choosing lash refills to maintain those dramatic eyelashes month after month. You just schedule a refill appointment every few weeks, and your lash artist can ensure that your eyelashes continue to look their very best at all times. During your lash consultation, ask your lash technician about refills and how often you should come back to have your extensions touched up.<\/p>\n<p>The good news is that eyelash extensions are one of the rare beauty enhancements that you can wear throughout the year, provided you schedule regular maintenance sessions to keep them at their aesthetic best. So, the next time you schedule your appointment to get the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ebenezereyelash.com\/\">best eyelash extensions in New York City<\/a>, be sure to ask the experts for more information about how refills can help you maintain those perfect lashes.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>One of the most common questions new eyelash extension wearers ask is how often they need to get a new set of extensions.
