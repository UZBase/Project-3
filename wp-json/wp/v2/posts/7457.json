Are you worried that the natural lash loss will be so noticeable that you\u2019ll have several weeks of bad lashes before your next application? What would you say if we told you that you can have great-looking lashes without enduring those problems? Well, you can \u2013 and the solution is as simple as coming in for a lash touch-up!<\/p>\n<p>The lash touch-up \u2013 more commonly referred to as \u2018refills\u2019 \u2013 is a great way to ensure that your natural lash cycle doesn\u2019t detract from those perfect lashes. To understand how refills can help to maintain those perfect lashes, it\u2019s important to know about your lash cycle and how lash refills can help to make your lash extensions even more effective.<\/p>\n<h2>Natural Lashes Inevitably Fall Out<\/h2>\n<p>Your natural eyelashes don\u2019t last forever. As a rule, they tend to complete their growth cycle every two to three months \u2013 and then fall out as they are replaced by new growth. Of course, different lashes fall out at different times \u2013 which is why most of us don\u2019t notice the changes that take place over time. On average, a person can lose anywhere from one lash to five or more lashes a day! Naturally, when a lash falls out, the extension falls out with it.<\/p>\n<p>Because of this natural cycle of growth and shedding, your lashes are all at a different state of maturity. This can result in some noticeable differences in lash length and thickness, even when you\u2019re not wearing extensions. With extensions, those shorter, less mature lashes can sometimes stand out like a sore thumb!\u00a0 That\u2019s where refills come into play.<\/p>\n<h2>Refills Can Bridge the Gap Between Full Applications<\/h2>\n<p>When you get a lash touch-up every two to four weeks, your lash technician can provide replacement extensions for those newer lashes. That can help you to maintain longer, thicker, and perfect lashes over a longer period of time. And since your technician will only apply new extensions to the stronger new lashes (leaving the newborn lashes alone so that they have time to grow and strengthen), your lash health will be preserved as well.<\/p>\n<p>That refill can ensure that you continue to greet the world with lush, beautiful lashes each day. Best of all, most touch-ups can be done in far less time than the full application \u2013 which means that you\u2019ll have more time to enjoy life with your gorgeous lashes!<\/p>\n<h2>Commit to Consistently Beautiful Lashes<\/h2>\n<p>At Ebenezer Eyelash, we believe that every woman deserves to look and feel her best each and every day.
