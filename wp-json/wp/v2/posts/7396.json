(No \u2013 No, You Shouldn\u2019t!)"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>If you follow beauty trends at all, chances are that you\u2019ve run across any number of horror stories from people who are eager to warn women about the dangers of eyelash extensions. The truth is that those types of stories can deter even the most adventurous of souls from getting a lash extension application. But do those types of warnings really tell even part of the tale? Should you be afraid of eyelash extensions? The answer is simple, and is evidenced by millions of women who routinely wear these beauty enhancement products: there is nothing to fear from professionally-applied lash extensions!<\/p>\n<h2>Fear of Lost Lashes<\/h2>\n<p>Stories about lost lashes appear from time to time, and it\u2019s only natural that these tales would inspire some level of dread in any woman who\u2019s considering extensions. After all, who wants to watch as their extensions and natural lashes shed uncontrollably? Here\u2019s the thing, though: that\u2019s not something that should happen under normal circumstances. When properly applied and cared for, lash extensions should last for the life of the lash.<\/p>\n<p>What does that mean for you? Well, it mainly means that you need to rely on properly-trained and licensed lash technicians to handle your extensions application needs. That\u2019s the best way to protect yourself against that type of misfortune. In addition, you need to closely follow all aftercare instructions. If you\u2019re pulling on your lashes, or sleeping on your face, you shouldn\u2019t be surprised to see lashes fall out. In other words, mass lash loss is something that you can easily avoid.<\/p>\n<h2>Fear of Irritation<\/h2>\n<p>You might have also heard that lash extensions have, on occasion, caused irritation to the skin and eyes. The good news is that this too is a rare phenomenon, and one that is easily avoided. In most instances, irritation is the result of sensitivity to the adhesives used in the application process, and generally occurs when the adhesive contacts the skin. Well-trained technicians can help you to avoid that fate by providing perfect applications every time you get your extensions.<\/p>\n<h2>Fear of Infection<\/h2>\n<p>Of all the things that worry would-be extension wearers, the fear of infection must rank right near the top. Nobody wants to suffer a skin or eye infection, so this concern is perfectly understandable. Infections can be avoided, of course, with proper application and aftercare. In most instances, clients only end up with infections when they fail to properly clean their lashes and allow bacteria and debris to build up along the eyeline or the lash. Proper hygiene is the only real safeguard you need!<\/p>\n<p>While these concerns have some merit, they all represent potential problems that can be avoided with foresight and attention to detail. At Ebenezer Eyelash, our trained and licensed technicians can provide the perfect application you need to counter all these worries.
