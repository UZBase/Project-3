While each woman has her own unique reasons for wanting lash enhancements, they all share one thing in common: they want to ensure that they make the most out of their new eyelash extensions. Here are five of the best strategies to help you accomplish that goal.<\/p>\n<h2>Know What You Want<\/h2>\n<p>Lash extensions can be used to provide a wide variety of appearance enhancements. Some women get them to bolster their natural look, providing limp, sparse lashes with bold, new life. Others are looking for that movie star glamour that\u2019s so popular in many parts of the country these days. Any option is a good option, but it\u2019s important to know what you want before you begin. That\u2019ll help you to be more comfortable with your choice and get more enjoyment out of those extensions.<\/p>\n<h2>Minimize Makeup<\/h2>\n<p>Be forewarned: you\u2019re going to want to do away with your mascara and much of your other makeup items. A minimalist approach will not only protect the extensions but can also help you to avoid that \u201coverly made-up\u201d look.<\/p>\n<h2>Watch How You Sleep<\/h2>\n<p>If you sleep on your face or have a habit of rolling over in your sleep, you may want to do something to prevent yourself from rolling onto your lashes. That sleeping habit can result in crushed and bent extensions \u2013 and could even lead to early shedding. Prop some pillows up to keep you on your back or side.<\/p>\n<h2>Clean Those Lashes Daily<\/h2>\n<p>We know you don\u2019t want an infection or irritation in your eyes or lashes, but that could happen if you fail to keep them clean. Dirt, oil, and other debris can accumulate and form ideal nesting grounds for bacteria that can lead to infection or rashes. Cleanse those lashes each day, using a gentle cleaner.<\/p>\n<h2>Leave Those Cotton Balls Alone<\/h2>\n<p>If you use cotton pads or balls to remove eyeliner or other makeup, you should try a different option when you have extensions. Those lashes can get caught in that large mass of cotton fibers, and end up falling out. Your best option is to minimize the makeup you use around your eyes. Failing that, try using cotton swabs instead to ensure that you can better avoid the lashes.<\/p>\n<p>At Ebenezer Eyelash, we know that it can sometimes be a struggle to get the most out of your eyelash extensions \u2013 especially after a lifetime of glamour habits have set in. The good news is that your lash extensions can be your new best friend, and can help you to look and feel your best if you know what you want and learn how to maintain them.
