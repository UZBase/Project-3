For many of those women, however, lash extensions can remain something of a mystery even after months of wear. One of the most common questions involves the use of mascara by extension-wearers. Should mascara be applied to lash extensions, or will it somehow negatively impact those extensions and cause them to fall out? While opinions tend to vary, there is a simple answer: it depends.<\/p>\n<h2>Many Women Find That Mascara is Unnecessary<\/h2>\n<p>In many instances, women who get lash extensions discover that they no longer need to wear mascara. Their new extensions are dark, thick, long, and perfectly curled \u2013 and often look as good as any mascara application. For those women, applying mascara would simply be redundant, and might detract from the perfectly elegant look they\u2019ve achieved with extensions.<\/p>\n<p>But what of those women whose new lash extensions are not quite as bold or dramatic as they\u2019d like? After all, while every woman can enhance her lashes with extensions, not everyone has the ideal eyelashes needed for those more dramatic extension choices. Women with thin or weak lashes often need to settle for lighter extensions, or an application that applies fewer lash extensions. For these women, mascara may seem like the perfect solution to complete their lash transformation.<\/p>\n<h2>It is Safe to Use Mascara \u2013 But Caution is Warranted<\/h2>\n<p>The good news is that women can wear mascara with their lashes if they really feel that they must. If you\u2019re one of those women, however, be advised that you may need to alter your traditional mascara routine. For example:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you typically use an oil-based mascara, forget about it. That oil could break down the adhesive that binds your extensions to your natural eyelashes, causing them to fall off. If you must wear mascara, follow this one simple rule: water-based products only.<\/li>\n<li>Apply mascara only to the tips of your extensions. Try to keep makeup away from the base, where it is likely to clump. Otherwise, your lashes will end up looking worse than they would without any mascara at all.<\/li>\n<li>Use water-based makeup removal products. This is wise advice even if you don\u2019t wear mascara with your extensions. It\u2019s always better to be safe than sorry.<\/li>\n<li>Be gentle when removing mascara or any makeup around the eyes. Don\u2019t pull, twist, or press your lashes. While the adhesive is strong enough to keep them intact when they\u2019re just sitting there, no adhesive is strong enough to prevent you from pulling or rubbing those lashes out of place.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>So, to review: While it is always preferable to avoid mascara with your lash extensions, there are options if you absolutely cannot resist turning to that old makeup friend. Just remember to be gentle with your extensions, avoid oily products, and thoroughly clean them when you\u2019re done. Remember, proper lash maintenance is the key to ensuring that you get the most out of your<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ebenezereyelash.com\/eyelash-extension-services\/\"> lash extensions<\/a>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Eyelash extensions have been growing in popularity in recent years, as millions of women have discovered the sheer joy of having fuller, longer lashes.
