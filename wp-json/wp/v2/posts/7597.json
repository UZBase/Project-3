Why it Happens and How to Correct It"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Every woman dreams of perfect lashes, but few of us are born with that aesthetic perfection. Fortunately, lash extensions are now available to help every woman achieve that perfect lash look. If you\u2019ve tried them, then you know exactly how great you look with that perfect set of long, lush, perfectly-curled lashes. But, as with any beauty enhancement, problems can sometimes arise. Take clumping, for example. Do you ever find that your lash extensions are clumped together? If so, then you need to know why that happens and how you can correct the problem. We have the answers you\u2019ve been looking for!<\/p>\n<h2>Why Do Lash Extensions Clump Together?<\/h2>\n<p>There are only a few reasons why your extensions would ever clump together. We\u2019ll look at each separately, and explain how you can address the issue:<\/p>\n<br \/>\n<h4>Your Lash Application Didn\u2019t Go as Planned<\/h4>\n<p>A bad lash application can often lead to clumped lashes \u2013 particularly if the person applying them didn\u2019t carefully glue one extensions to one natural lash. Do-it-yourself lash extensions often result in this problem, and it\u2019s easy to understand why. It\u2019s difficult to apply these extensions yourself, and all too easy to end up with one extension glued to multiple lashes \u2013 or vice versa. So, what\u2019s the answer?<\/p>\n<p>To avoid a bad application, rely on a trusted, competent lash extension salon. Licensed lash technicians have the training needed to ensure that your application will be conducted perfectly every time. So, choose wisely and remember \u2013 your lashes are too important to risk a do-it-yourself job!<\/p>\n<br \/>\n<h4>You\u2019ve Used Mascara, and It\u2019s Caused the Extensions to Stick Together<\/h4>\n<p>Mascara can be problematic as well, since it can lead to a greasy effect that acts to clump the lashes together in an unattractive and sometimes painful way. The reality is that your new lash extensions won\u2019t require mascara in most instances. But if you do feel the need to apply mascara, follow these simple tips:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Always use fresh mascara rather than old, dried makeup<\/li>\n<li>Brush the mascara on carefully, going from the brush to the tips<\/li>\n<li>Let the first coat dry before you even think about applying a second<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<br \/>\n<h4>Your Lashes Are Bent, Perhaps from Sleeping on Them<\/h4>\n<p>Your technician will probably advise you to avoid sleeping on your face, since extensions can become bent during your sleep. Of course, it can be difficult to avoid that sometimes, so what do you do when your extensions bend into each other? First, try to gently straighten them to return them to their natural curl. If that doesn\u2019t work, you may need to return to the salon to see if your technician can provide a solution.<\/p>\n<p>With the right care and attention, you can either avoid or correct lash extension clumping.
