Of course, sometimes that pain isn\u2019t physical, but the type of pain you experience when you take a hit to your pocketbook. Yes, beauty can be costly, and painfully so. Take eyelash extensions, for example. You know that you want them, but you can\u2019t help but wonder whether they\u2019re worth the cost. Moreover, you may have seen online articles or videos talking about do-it-yourself at-home lash extension applications and wondered whether you should just try that option rather than relying on a professional lash service. Before you give that any serious thought, here are three reasons you really shouldn\u2019t try that at-home lash application.<\/p>\n<h2>\nThe Application Requires Precision<\/h2>\n<p>Let\u2019s get this one out of the way first: you\u2019re not a trained lash technician. And even if you were, this is not the type of beauty enhancement that you can expect to perform on your own. At a salon, you will lie in the chair for around an hour \u2013 eyes closed \u2013 as the technician carefully and methodically applies lash extensions one-by-one, with each extension glued to an individual lash. That\u2019s the only way to get the best effect from the application.<\/p>\n<p>Now, picture yourself in front of your mirror, trying to glue each extension to a single lash. How accurate do you think you can be? If you\u2019re like most of us, chances are that you\u2019ll end up with clumped lashes, and find that you\u2019ve wasted your time and money on that DIY effort. Even worse, you could end up causing even more serious problems.<\/p>\n<h2>\nThere\u2019s Always the Adhesive to Consider<\/h2>\n<p>How much worse could it be than clumpy lashes? That\u2019s easy and can be explained with one word: adhesive. Lash salons use carefully-selected adhesive to glue those extensions to your lashes. Used incorrectly, it could glue your natural lashes together. Miss your lashes altogether and you could end up with adhesive on that delicate skin around the lashes \u2013 and cause irritation that might ultimately lead to an infection.<\/p>\n<h2>\nIt May Not Be as Safe as a Salon<\/h2>\n<p>Finally, there is the safety issue to consider. Lash salons employ trained technicians who know how to perform these applications in a safe, sterile environment. Can you say the same? What will you do when you try to do that application at home and end up getting debris, oils, or other foreign substances in your eye? How will you feel when you discover that your effort to save a few dollars ends up costing you a trip to the doctor \u2013 and an even bigger hit to your pocketbook?<\/p>\n<p>The fact is that it\u2019s always easier, more effective, and safer to have your lash extension application performed at a competent salon. Fortunately, Ebenezer Eyelash offers the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ebenezereyelash.com\/eyelash-extension-services\/\">best eyelash extension in New York City<\/a>, applied by trained, state-licensed technicians who truly care about helping you achieve the best results possible.
