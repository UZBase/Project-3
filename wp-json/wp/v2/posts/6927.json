When it comes to eyelash extensions, however, the question is this: are oil and water your new extensions\u2019 friends \u2013 or their worst enemies? Many people seem to be confused about which activities they can enjoy with their new lashes, and which products they should steer away from \u2013 and that can cause them to experience unnecessary anxiety over the durability of their extensions. Since we want all our clients to enjoy their lives as much as they can, let\u2019s dispel and myths about oil and water that might be causing undue stress.<\/p>\n<h2>Water is Not the Enemy<\/h2>\n<p>We always advise our clients to be careful around water for the first 24 hours after an extension application. As a result, some might assume that water remains a serious concern beyond the first day or two of aftercare. It\u2019s not! The reason for that first day of extreme caution has to do with the adhesive used in the application process. It generally takes between one and two days for the adhesive to complete its bonding process, and that can make the seal vulnerable to excess moisture. Once the bond is set, though, your fears about things like showering should subside.<\/p>\n<p>The reality is that water is your friend! If you\u2019re a swimmer, or spend a lot of time in the gym, you need not worry that your time in the pool or sweating to the oldies will cause your harm to your extensions. Obviously, you don\u2019t want to rub your eyes or pull at the extensions, since those activities can damage extensions as much as they can harm your actual eyelashes. At the same time, however, you don\u2019t have to disrupt your entire life out of fear that a few drops of perspiration will cause your lashes to melt like the witch in the Wizard of Oz.<\/p>\n<h2>Oil is Not Your Friend<\/h2>\n<p>Okay, so if water is only a threat in that first day after the appointment, the same probably holds true for oil, right? Unfortunately, no. Oil actually is a serious threat to the adhesive bonding that keeps your extensions attached to your lashes \u2013 and the last thing you want is to watch as your beautiful extensions come loose and drop to the floor! For that reason, you need to avoid using any oil-based eyeliners or mascara. We always recommend that our own clients clean away eyeliner and other eye makeup with Q-tips. As a general rule, of course, your extensions will last the longest when you don\u2019t have to touch them at all.<\/p>\n<p>At Ebenezer Eyelash, we want you to thoroughly enjoy your gorgeous eyelash extensions! Understanding how oil and water impact your lashes\u2019 durability can be an important part of your effort to keep them looking their best. Fortunately, with the right care and regular touchup appointments, you can keep your extensions in top form indefinitely.
