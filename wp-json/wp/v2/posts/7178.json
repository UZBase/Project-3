Chances are that your worries passed fairly quickly as the situation returned to normal within a few short days. That\u2019s a common phenomenon, since lashes have a natural cycle of growth and shedding that usually sees perhaps two eyelashes fall out every day \u2013 sometimes more and sometimes less. The real worry occurs when lashes start falling out in groups! If that happens, you may have some bad habits that are causing the excessive shedding. The good news is that eyelash extensions may be the solution you need.<\/p>\n<h2>Are You Rubbing Too Much?<\/h2>\n<p>If you\u2019re rubbing your eyelashes during your makeup removal process, you could be creating stress to the lashes. This can lead to lashes falling out due to the trauma your makeup routine creates. It\u2019s a risk that most women face when they rely on mascara to beautify their lashes.<\/p>\n<h2>Are You Curling Your Lashes?<\/h2>\n<p>If you\u2019re committed to regular curling of your lashes, you should know that your use of the curler could be putting undue stress on those delicate natural lashes. You could even be pulling them out without knowing it, especially when you\u2019re using your curler on lashes that already have mascara on them. Sometimes, lashes just aren\u2019t up to the task of enduring all that stress.<\/p>\n<h2>Do You Forget to Remove Your Mascara?<\/h2>\n<p>Almost every woman eventually goes to sleep with mascara on. If so, then chances are that you\u2019ve had lashes break or fall off while you\u2019re sleeping. Why? It\u2019s simple. Mascara causes the lash to harden somewhat, and that makes them more brittle. When they make contact with your pillow, those hardened lashes can sometimes break.<\/p>\n<h2>How Lash Extensions Can Help<\/h2>\n<p>If you\u2019re suffering ongoing lash loss due to these common habits, eyelash extensions might be the solution you need. Here\u2019s why:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>With extensions, you no longer need mascara. That means that you won\u2019t need to rub your eyes to remove the makeup. Instead, you only need gentle daily lash cleansings to remove bacteria and debris.<\/li>\n<li>Your extensions have a natural curl. When attached to your natural lashes, you get the perfectly-curled lashes you need without subjecting yourself to the rigors of the lash curler.<\/li>\n<li>You\u2019ll also never have to worry about forgetting to remove that mascara, since you won\u2019t be wearing it. Your new lashes will already have that full, perfectly-tinted look you need, and won\u2019t be so brittle that they break off when you\u2019re asleep.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Obviously, eyelash extensions aren\u2019t some miracle product that can resolve all your lash problems, but they could be the solution to some of the most common lash loss difficulties you might be facing.
