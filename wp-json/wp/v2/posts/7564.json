If you\u2019re an eyelash extension wearer, then you already understand many of the basic guidelines for the perfect lash lifestyle. Still, there are always helpful tips and suggestions that can enhance that lifestyle. The good news is that your lash technician can be a source of tremendous wisdom when it comes to living with lash extensions. Here are five things that your lash technician wants you to know.<\/p>\n<h2>Don\u2019t Hesitate to Tell Us What You Want<\/h2>\n<p>When you go to your appointment, you almost certainly have an idea about what you want. Don\u2019t be shy about expressing your desires to your technician. That way, you can better guarantee that you\u2019ll end up with the look you want, and there won\u2019t be any unwelcome surprises.<\/p>\n<p>Once the application begins, though, it\u2019s usually best to keep talking to a minimum to avoid any excess movement that might interfere with your perfect lash extensions application.<\/p>\n<h2>Longer Isn\u2019t Always Better<\/h2>\n<p>Sometimes, lash clients assume that they can only get dramatic lashes by using the longest possible extensions. That\u2019s simply not the case, though. Your extensions should be carefully selected to accommodate your natural lashes while still achieving the look you desire.<\/p>\n<h2>Lash Loss is Natural<\/h2>\n<p>Lash extensions are not going to be with you for life. Since they are attached to your natural lashes, they come off as those lashes shed. It\u2019s a natural process! Moreover, most of us lose several lashes a day; we just don\u2019t typically notice the shedding. With your new extensions, however, those lashes may be more noticeable. Don\u2019t panic if you see one or two lying on your pillow in the morning, though \u2013 chances are that\u2019s just part of your own natural lash cycle.<\/p>\n<h2>Avoid Caffeine Before Your Session<\/h2>\n<p>Do you love a great-tasting cup of coffee or a sparkling soda to start your day? Well, try not to drink anything with caffeine in it within an hour or two of your appointment. Caffeine can produce more rapid eye fluttering, which could interfere with your application. Your best bet is to maybe plan a trip to the coffee shop after your appointment!<\/p>\n<h2>Water is Not the Enemy<\/h2>\n<p>You\u2019ve heard that you can\u2019t get your extensions wet for 24-hours after your appointment, right? That\u2019s true \u2013 but that doesn\u2019t mean that you shouldn\u2019t get them wet afterwards. In fact, you should wet them daily to clean them and avoid any buildup of debris or bacteria. In addition, you can feel free to swim, bathe, shower, and engage in other water-born activities.<\/p>\n<p>At Ebenezer Eyelash, we know how important it is for our clients to have the information they need to maximize their lash extension enjoyment. These and similar tips can help to form a knowledge foundation that will enable any lash wearer to feel more knowledgeable and comfortable with her new lash extensions.
