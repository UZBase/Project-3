Only a relatively small portion of those lash extension users ever experience irritation or allergies, which is why so many experts confirm that these eyelash enhancements are a safe and effective way for people to get those perfect lashes they\u2019ve always dreamed about. Still, irritation can occur in some cases, and it\u2019s important to understand why it can sometimes happen. As it turns out, when non-allergic irritation occurs it is most commonly due to improper aftercare at home.<\/p>\n<h2>Irritation in the Spa Can Occur<\/h2>\n<p>It is certainly true that some people can experience irritation as a result of their lash extension applications. In most instances, that irritation is caused by adhesive that ends up too close to the eyeline. This typically results in some mild redness or itchiness, and goes away within twenty-four hours in most instances. If you\u2019ve ever experienced the itchiness that can occur when a band-aid is placed on your skin, then there\u2019s a good chance that you may experience this mild irritation with your lash extensions.<\/p>\n<p>This irritation is short-lived, and passes quickly. More importantly, it is a rare thing to encounter in a spa with highly-trained and licensed technicians. Steady hands and an experienced touch can make all the difference in the world!<\/p>\n<h2>Irritation at Home<\/h2>\n<p>More commonly, people with eyelash extensions can encounter redness around the eye and itching sensations in the days and weeks after their application. This is often the result of improper aftercare, or bad habits like pulling at the lashes or rubbing the eyes. When you\u2019re relying on a professional spa with a proven track record of success, you can typically discount the application as a contributing factor in any irritation. When applied properly, the adhesive and extensions never touch the skin.<\/p>\n<p>In many instances, the irritation can be caused by dirt, oil, and debris that\u2019s accumulated in the lashes and extensions. This can create an irritation effect, and could even lead to an infection without proper care. Sadly, this often occurs due to the wearer\u2019s fear of getting the extensions wet. If you\u2019ve been avoiding water for fear of ruining your extensions, stop. The fact is that you need to wash your lashes with a gentle rinse each day to help keep them clean and free from irritation and infection-causing debris.<\/p>\n<p>If the skin around your eyes is itchy or red after an extension application, don\u2019t panic. Wait a day and gently wash and rinse them to ensure that they\u2019re clean. If the problem persists, consult with your technician to see what remedies are available.<\/p>\n<p>Fortunately, irritation is an uncommon phenomenon, and most people can wear eyelash extensions without incident.
