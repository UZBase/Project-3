Many will wonder why their lashes are falling out like that \u2013 and some may even wonder whether the extensions are to blame. The reality is something far simpler: your lashes shad as part of a natural lash growth cycle. Old lashes fall out, and new ones grow in to take their place. To better understand this process, here are six things we all need to know about lash shedding.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The process is indeed natural. The average eyelash has a life expectancy of between two and three months. That means that each lash will fall out every sixty or ninety days. The good news is that they don\u2019t all fall out at once!<\/li>\n<li>This lash shedding cycle means that the average person will lose anywhere from one to five eyelashes a day. Over the course of a two-week period, you may shed as much as twenty percent of all your eyelashes. Hair growth is a natural and continuous process.<\/li>\n<li>New hairs take those lost lashes\u2019 place very quickly. How fast? Well, so quickly that you probably don\u2019t even notice the exchange. That\u2019s good news too, since it means that you have options to keep your new lash extensions looking their best. When your lashes start to look a little less than perfect, simply make an appointment and have your lash technician apply a lash refill to add extensions to those new lashes too. Voila! Perfect lashes!<\/li>\n<li>Lash extensions make your lash shedding more noticeable. There\u2019s a reason you may have never noticed your lash loss prior to getting extensions. Natural lashes are shorter, less dramatic, and generally lighter in color than your perfect extensions. The extensions are more dramatic-looking, and easier to spot when you shed.<\/li>\n<li>You can disrupt your lash shed cycle by pulling your natural lashes out. That causes the new lashes to grow in more slowly. Naturally, this is a bad thing and something that you should avoid at all costs! Still, it\u2019s important to understand the risk, so that you treat your lashes with respect and care.<\/li>\n<li>There\u2019s no reason to panic. This cannot be emphasized enough \u2013 especially for fans of lash extensions. It\u2019s only natural for someone to worry when she sees several of those wonderfully long lashes lying about a few days after getting a new set of extensions. However, it\u2019s important to remain calm and recognize that it really is normal to lose a few of these lashes each day. Just commit to a reasonable refill appointment schedule and continue to enjoy your perfect lashes.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Eyelash hairs are like every other hair on your body. They continually grow, fall out, and regrow over the course of a lifetime. If you understand that process and learn to adjust your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ebenezereyelash.com\/eyelash-extension-services\/\">lash extension<\/a> routine accordingly, you can enjoy greater peach of mind and the comfort that comes from knowing that your lash loss isn\u2019t anything unexpected or out of the ordinary.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>One of the most distressing things that any lash extension client can experience after an application is waking up to see several of those perfect lashes lying on the pillow.
