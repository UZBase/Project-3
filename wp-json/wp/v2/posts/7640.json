Like all beauty enhancements, however, there is often a learning curve involved caring for extensions. If you\u2019re a woman who has put off the decision to get extensions due to concerns about that care, it\u2019s important to understand just how simple it really is. In fact, caring for your lash extensions is easy!<\/p>\n<p>Of course, that is not to say that there are not certain requirements and restrictions. There are specific things that you must do to maintain your extensions \u2013 and specific things that you need to avoid if you want to make them last. The point is, though, that these requirements and restrictions are pretty basic, and won\u2019t typically disrupt your life in any meaningful way. For example:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Always clean your lash extensions daily. The reason for this is simple: if you don\u2019t you will leave your natural lashes and eyeline vulnerable to bacteria and debris that can increase the likelihood of irritation and infection.<\/li>\n<li>Never sleep on your face. Your extensions could bend, twist together, or even fall off.<\/li>\n<li>Always be cognizant of your natural lash shed cycle. To keep your extensions looking their best, you should plan on getting them touched up every few weeks or monthly.<\/li>\n<li>Never spend time in extremely hot environments like a sauna. The steam can break down the adhesive bond that keeps your extensions attached to your natural lashes.<\/li>\n<li>Always take a few moments each day to gently brush through the lashes, preferably after you\u2019ve cleaned them. That can help to remove any excess water and debris \u2013 and will ensure that they don\u2019t become tangled.<\/li>\n<li>Never pull or play with your lash extensions. If that\u2019s a habit that you\u2019ve struggled to break, now is the best time to stop it once and for all.<\/li>\n<li>Always use oil-free makeup removers. Some oils can weaken the lash glue and cause the extensions to fall out of place.<\/li>\n<li>Never go crazy with mascara applications to eyelash extensions. In fact, get used to the idea that you won\u2019t need mascara at all. A great set of lash extensions will provide you with all the volume, curl, thickness, and length that you need for perfect lashes.<\/li>\n<li>Do stay with the same lash salon and rely on technicians that you trust and appreciate. The best lash artists know their customers\u2019 lashes well and can ensure that your application is everything that you hoped it would be.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Oh, and one more thing: don\u2019t be afraid of the water. You will need it to properly wash those lashes each day. Just avoid getting them wet for the first 24-hours after the application is done.<\/p>\n<p>As you can see, there are only a few rules to follow when caring for extensions. That ease-of-use is one reason that millions of women have turned to extensions for their beauty needs. If you\u2019ve yet to try them yourself, there\u2019s never been a better \u2013 or easier \u2013 time to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ebenezereyelash.com\/eyelash-extension-services\/\">get the perfect lashes<\/a> you deserve.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Eyelash extensions have rapidly become a popular choice for many women, as they eagerly embrace the life-changing benefits offered by perfect lashes.
