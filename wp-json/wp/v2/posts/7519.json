They add fullness, length, and a dramatic flair to any look, and can simplify almost any beauty routine. Naturally, we all want our lash extensions to last for as long as possible, so that those benefits continue. To ensure that longevity, though, you need to avoid habits and behaviors that might threaten those delicate lashes. Here are five of those habits, and why you should avoid them.<\/p>\n<h2>Rubbing Your Eyes<\/h2>\n<p>We all do it from time to time. Our eyes get tired and we react by rubbing them with our hands. Unfortunately, that rubbing can play havoc with your extensions. Remember, one of the most basic elements of extension aftercare is to never pull on your lashes. Well, rubbing has much the same impact on those extensions. Simply put, avoid it all costs.<\/p>\n<h2>Using a Blow Dryer<\/h2>\n<p>If you use a blow dryer, it\u2019s important to know how to do so without damaging your lashes. There are only three options available: use a relatively cool setting to save the extensions from that heat, angle the dryer away from lashes at all times, or let your hair dry naturally.<\/p>\n<h2>Spending Time in the Sauna<\/h2>\n<p>If the heat from a blow dryer can uncurl your lashes, what do you think the heat from a steamy-hot sauna can do? That\u2019s right: all that steam has the potential to weaken the adhesive bond that holds your extensions in place. Before you know it, you could be looking at a costly set of disconnected lash extensions! Our advice: find another way to open those pores.<\/p>\n<h2>Using a Tanning Bed<\/h2>\n<p>Women who tan often face similar challenges, especially if they use tanning beds. The focused heat can weaken lash curl, and potentially weaken the adhesive. The good news is that you can avoid this effect by wearing goggles. And yes, in case you were wondering, that goes for spray tans too. Goggles are your extensions\u2019 best friend.<\/p>\n<h2>Applying and Removing Mascara<\/h2>\n<p>So, you paid for a new set of lash extensions, sat in the salon for an hour or so, and you are still applying mascara every day? While you can get away with using some mascara products, let\u2019s be clear: with a great set of eyelash extensions, you don\u2019t need mascara. But if you absolutely must wear it, choose a water-based product and exercise great care during both the application and removal process.<\/p>\n<p>Bad habits are hard to break, but your lash extensions are counting on you to make the right choices.
