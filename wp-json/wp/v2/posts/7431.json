If you\u2019ve been paying attention, you probably noticed that there is a great deal of diversity in lash style. They\u2019re not just a one-size-fits-all beauty enhancement, after all, and each woman needs to decide for herself which \u201clook\u201d is right for her. The fact is that there are many different looks from which you can choose. If you\u2019ve been thinking about trying eyelash extensions for yourself, here are three stunning lash extensions styles that you should seriously consider.<\/p>\n<h2>The Star<\/h2>\n<p>Whether you call it the \u201ccelebrity\u201d look, the \u201cglam\u201d option, or some other name, one thing is for certain: you\u2019ll look like a star when you go for this look. It\u2019s a bold choice, with striking lashes designed to perfectly frame your gorgeous eyes. This is a look that\u2019s favored by many celebrities, and it adds a touch of daring-do to any woman\u2019s appearance. One caveat, though; there are a lot of lashes involved in putting this look together. Consequently, it\u2019s not typically suitable for women with thinning lashes.<\/p>\n<h2>Flirtatious<\/h2>\n<p>The flirty look is something that many women try to achieve with their natural lashes. It\u2019s all about adding more thickness and length to the lashes. Some women are very adept at creating the illusion of thicker lashes, with creative application of mascara. However, lash extensions can provide that look without the hassle of putting on makeup and removing it every night. This option works great for women with almost any type of natural lash. Whether your natural eyelashes are thick or thin, the flirtatious look could be right for you.<\/p>\n<h2>The Signature<\/h2>\n<p>If you want something with even more volume than that flirtatious look, the signature option might be right up your alley. In fact, if you tend to rely on a heavy application of mascara to create the appearance of volume, chances are that the signature look could save you that time and trouble. It\u2019s a great everyday lash extension choice that is suitable for work, play, and everything in-between. It offers long, thick lashes, maximum definition for your eyelash line, and a more natural appearance that you\u2019ll feel comfortable wearing year-round.<\/p>\n<p>There are a host of other options as well, so be sure to talk to your lash technician if you have a specific look in mind.
