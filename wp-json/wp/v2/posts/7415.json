While many slightly older women might be curious about this new beauty trend, younger women seem to have embraced these beauty enhancements. That\u2019s really no surprise, though, since the young are often among the first to adopt any innovation \u2013 as we\u2019ve repeatedly seen with new technologies. Still, what is it about eyelash extensions that has so captivated that younger demographic?<\/p>\n<h2>Millennials Have Instant Exposure to Beauty Trends<\/h2>\n<p>There was a time when women had to read beauty magazines to keep abreast of all the latest beauty fads and trends. Those days are gone. Today, television and the internet have made it possible for women to see new trends as they emerge. Social media has provided an outlet for those women to follow other people\u2019s beauty choices in real-time. Celebrity beauty trends are broadcast around the world daily. That exposure can\u2019t help but have a major impact on how millennials process information about new beauty trends.<\/p>\n<h2>Millennial Confidence<\/h2>\n<p>It might sound clich\u00e9, but there is something to the idea that millennials are a confident generation. They\u2019ve grown up in a society that is perhaps more tolerant of divergent ideas and preferences than it has been at any previous time in history. Yes, the 60s and 70s were somewhat free-wheeling, but that was a time of social rebellion as an entire generation dramatically broke with their parents\u2019 traditions. Today\u2019s millennials are demonstrating a different kind of freedom \u2013 the freedom to be who they are.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s why so many young women don\u2019t think twice about making eyelash extensions a part of their beauty lifestyle. These millennials are often more comfortable with setting their own trends than their parents and grandparents might have been. Many of them are also less likely to try to pretend that their lash extensions are anything other than what they are: beauty enhancements. They have the confidence to wear lash extensions, hair extensions, and other enhancements without caring whether anyone knows about it.<\/p>\n<h2>Convenience Matters<\/h2>\n<p>Millennials are a busy generation \u2013 but they\u2019re also open to trying just about anything that can remove clutter from their lives. And while many older women might have just accepted that mascara and other makeup enhancements are simply an unavoidable part of life, millennials often view things differently. Eyelash extensions allow them to free up time and simplify their beauty regimen. That\u2019s time that can be spent on other interests, and these young women aren\u2019t afraid to take advantage of that opportunity.<\/p>\n<p>Most importantly, though, millennial women just know a good thing when they see it! At Ebenezer Eyelash, we\u2019re committed to helping these young women \u2013 and women of all ages \u2013 get the professional eyelash extension applications they need to make the most of their beauty regimens.
