After all, Marlowe might have written of Helen of Troy that hers was \u201cthe face that launched a thousand ships\u201d &#8211; but it\u2019s a pretty good bet that the eyes on that face played a pretty big role in capturing the heart of young Paris. Face it; your eyes are often the first thing that people see when they look at your face, and the last thing they remember when you\u2019ve bid them farewell.<\/p>\n<p>Because of the powerful role the eyes play in projecting a person\u2019s image to the world, women rightly focus much of their beauty attention on enhancements to showcase those beautiful orbs. For most, that means eyeliner, mascara, eyeshadow, lash perms, and even colored contacts. In recent years, however, another option for eye beauty enhancement has re-emerged: eyelash extensions. When done properly, a full and lush set of gently curled eyelash extensions can help to create the lasting impression every woman desires.<\/p>\n<h2>Who Says the Eyes Matter?<\/h2>\n<p>That\u2019s always a good question to ask, right? Other than poets and people who write clever greeting cards, what evidence is there that the eyes are really that important when it comes to how others perceive us? Well, science says so. In fact, of the top five human features that people rate when judging someone\u2019s attractiveness, the eyes consistently rate at or near the top of the list. Moreover, <a href=\"http:\/\/pss.sagepub.com\/content\/early\/2014\/07\/15\/0956797614539706\">research<\/a> even indicates that the eyes are a central focus for serious interpersonal interaction.<\/p>\n<p>All of that sees practical application in our efforts to shape, brighten, and highlight our eyes with all of the many tools and techniques mankind has developed over the centuries. Eyelash extensions might be a relative newcomer when it comes to eye-enhancing technologies, but they are taking the world by storm and providing many women with a great alternative to countless hours of lash curling and tinting.<\/p>\n<p>However, there is a key to getting the most out of any set of lashes \u2013 and it isn\u2019t found in those cheap drug store extension sets that you apply on your own. As any woman who\u2019s ever tried those self-applications understands, that path lies to madness, sticky fingers, and a mass of clumped confusion where your lashes should be. To truly get the best results for your eyes, you need the lash applications that only trained and licensed professionals can provide.<\/p>\n<p>At Ebenezer Eyelash, our licensed aestheticians are committed to helping you get the perfect lashes you deserve.
