Most women have felt that desire at one time or another. After all, long lashes can be vital for framing your eyes and drawing attention to one of your most beautiful assets. Unfortunately, most of us aren\u2019t born with perfect eyelashes, which is why mascara and other eye makeup products exist. Still, makeup isn\u2019t the only option for dealing with short, uninspiring lashes. In this article, we\u2019ll examine some celebrated solutions to this lash problem, including eyelash extensions.<\/p>\n<h2>Castor Oil<\/h2>\n<p>Proponents of castor oil suggest that it can help to stimulate lash growth. There\u2019s been no evidence to support this, however. At best, castor oil can be a useful tool for helping to make your lashes softer \u2013 something that might be beneficial for women whose lashes tend to be dry and brittle. If you\u2019re looking for added growth, look elsewhere.<\/p>\n<h2>Eyelash Growth Serum<\/h2>\n<p>There are products on the market that can help to stimulate lash growth. These serums are somewhat pricey, but they will help many women to obtain longer lashes over time. There is a drawback, of course. Once you start using the serum, you need to continue usage to maintain that length. The results are only temporary. More importantly, though, these serums are not always effective.<\/p>\n<h2>Falsies<\/h2>\n<p>False eyelashes are a well-known tool that many women use to give themselves longer lashes. Typically, women who wear falsies do so for special occasions \u2013 like a wedding, or other social gathering. This option provides longer, fuller lashes at a cost-effective price. You put them on when you need them, and take them off with ease. Unfortunately, most don\u2019t look natural, and that kind of defeats the purpose. Still, if you\u2019re just looking for a temporary solution and don\u2019t mind everyone knowing that you\u2019re wearing fake lashes, this can be the perfect way to achieve that goal.<\/p>\n<h2>Lash Extensions<\/h2>\n<p>Lash extensions are an increasingly popular option for women who want to transform their lashes and get the glamorous look they\u2019ve always dreamed of enjoying. Each extension is glued to a separate lash, providing added length and thickness \u2013 and just the right amount of natural curl. A full set of extensions takes about an hour to apply, and you can schedule recurring appointments for refills to maintain your set for many months.<\/p>\n<p>Because of those benefits \u2013 and the great look you\u2019ll enjoy with your new, dazzling eyelashes, extensions rank at the top of any list of lash-lengthening options. The only caveat is that you need to ensure that your extensions are applied by trained and licensed professionals who are committed to providing the best lash applications in the area.<\/p>\n<p>At Ebenezer Eyelash, our fully-licensed lash technicians will ensure that your lashes always look and feel their best.
