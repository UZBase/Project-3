Many extension-wearers fail to follow through on their aftercare responsibilities, and that often leads to problems down the road. Some are left to lament as the extensions fall our prematurely. Others end up with tangled or broken extensions. In almost every instance, problems could have been easily avoided had those women committed to proper aftercare. And one of the most important elements of that aftercare is daily lash brushing.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, there are good reasons why you should never forget to brush your lashes and extensions. For that matter, you should be brushing your lashes daily even if you\u2019re not wearing extensions \u2013 and for many of the same reasons that you brush the hair on your head. The fact is that hair \u2013 including the follicles that support your extensions \u2013 requires regular maintenance to remain at its cleanest and healthiest best. Need more reasons to always remember your daily lash brushing? Try these:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>When you brush your extensions, you can help to remove any dust, pollen, oils, or eye makeup that may accumulate on the lashes throughout the day. Brushing dislodges those particles more effectively than your daily wash and rinse, preventing buildup over time.<\/li>\n<li>Daily brushing can remove bacteria that could cause irritation of the eyes or even infection. To avoid those problems, make sure to use a mild cleaner, clear water rinse, and a clean lash brush to gently comb through your lashes and extensions.<\/li>\n<li>Brushing is also an important part of your overall lash maintenance routine. When you brush each day, you can help to keep your lashes and extensions from becoming tangled, bent, or unkempt. That will ensure that you maintain their aesthetic appeal, while preventing them from suffering unnecessary damage or wear and tear.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Brushing Properly<\/h2>\n<p>Naturally, you need to know how to brush properly. These tips can help:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Always use a clean lash brush or mascara wand to avoid transferring bacteria to the eyes.<\/li>\n<li>Brush from the middle of the extension to the end of the lash. Never start at the base, since that could result in the brush pulling the extension out.<\/li>\n<li>For optimal results, brush the bottom of your extensions and the top of each lash. That\u2019s the best way to ensure that you remove every offending particle of dust, oil, or debris.<\/li>\n<li>Do this at least once a day. While it\u2019s good to have an established routine and a set time for brushing, don\u2019t be afraid to brush whenever you notice lashes going in the wrong direction or looking otherwise disheveled.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>At Ebenezer Eyelash, we know that your lash extensions are an important beauty investment, and we want to help you keep them looking their best for as long as possible.
