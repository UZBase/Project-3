Millions of women have become reliant on their extensions to provide them with the perfect eyelashes they\u2019ve longed for all their lives. Of course, those extensions don\u2019t last forever since their actual life cycle is tied directly to the lifespan of the natural lashes to which they are attached. Still, it is important to do what you can to maximize that life cycle and get the most out of your extensions. These tips can help you accomplish that goal.<\/p>\n<h2>\nBe Mindful of the Natural Life Cycle<\/h2>\n<p>First, it\u2019s important to recognize that your natural lashes regularly shed. As a rule, lashes fall out every two or three months, with several lashes shedding each day. That\u2019s an inescapable fact of life, unfortunately. Your job is to ensure that those natural lashes remain in good health to maintain that regular cycle and avoid unexpected shedding that might negatively impact the look of your extensions.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>To protect those lashes, clean them and the extensions with a mild cleanser at least once a day. Gently work the cleanser into the lashes to remove dust, debris, and bacteria.<\/li>\n<li>Never pull at your lashes, cut the extensions, or pluck them. That could damage the natural lashes and even cause additional lash loss that will leave noticeable gaps in your extensions.<\/li>\n<li>Eat healthy foods, drink plenty of water, and avoid excessive heat, wind, and other environmental factors that could dry out the lashes and weaken them over time.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>\nProtecting Your Extensions<\/h2>\n<p>Naturally, you will need to protect your extensions as well. The goal should be to safeguard them from harm so that they remain firmly attached to your natural lashes until those lashes shed in their own time.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Avoid oily makeups and cleaners. Oil can potentially break down some adhesives, which could cause the extensions to lose their connection to the natural lashes.<\/li>\n<li>Don\u2019t rub your eyes.<\/li>\n<li>Try not to sleep on your face. That could put extra pressure on the extensions and cause shedding \u2013 and you don\u2019t want to see a host of lashes lying on your pillowcase in the morning, do you?<\/li>\n<li>Skip the mascara. Let\u2019s face it; your lash extensions will give you the dark, lush, perfectly curled lashes you want anyway, so why overdo things? By skipping the mascara, you can avoid the cleanup and potential weakening of the lash extension bond.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>\nProtecting Your Look<\/h2>\n<p>Finally, it is important to know how to protect that perfect lash look. Since shedding is a natural part of the lash cycle, it is inevitable that you will eventually start to see sparser areas in your lash line. To keep them looking as full as possible, you should have filler applications every few weeks. That will keep your lash extensions on-point year-round!<\/p>\n<p>At Ebenezer Eyelash, our highly trained and licensed technicians are committed to providing you with the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ebenezereyelash.com\/eyelash-extension-services\/\">best lash extensions in New York City<\/a>.
