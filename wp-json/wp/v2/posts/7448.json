Will they damage my natural lashes? Will they look natural? Can my lashes support a full set of extensions? The problem is that even the most extensive review of available information about eyelash extensions is likely to leave you with more questions than answered. One question that we\u2019ve heard asked many times has to do with lash extension weight: is there a certain weight limit that you should adhere to when it comes to your lash extensions.<\/p>\n<h2>Weight Does Matter!<\/h2>\n<p>The fact is that the weight of your eyelash extensions could have a huge impact on how well your lashes perform over time. Some clients may think that they want to sport the longest, heaviest lashes they can get so that they can achieve a truly dramatic lash look. The problem is that every person\u2019s lashes are different. A woman with strong, long lashes can often support heavier lashes. Another woman with weaker lashes may find that those heavier options are not a viable choice.<\/p>\n<p>And that\u2019s what makes this so difficult. Most of us are never truly sure about our own lashes until we\u2019re sitting in a chair and listening to a technician describe them to us. We think we know how strong they are. We want to believe that we can carry the heaviest of extensions without risk to our natural lashes. But are we really the best judge of such things? And if not, who is?<\/p>\n<h2>Listen to Your Lash Technician<\/h2>\n<p>When you put your trust in a well-respected lash salon, you can rest assured that you\u2019re dealing with experienced technicians who can fairly evaluate your natural lashes. Even if you think that you know what you want before you ever step foot in the door, it\u2019s important to consult with that technician to get an honest assessment of your best options. In most salons, that technician will make recommendations about length, weight, and other important factors. You should always take those recommendations into consideration before you make a final decision.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, if you want a heavier lash than your technician recommends, chances are that your insistence will be honored and you\u2019ll get the lashes you request. You may even be right about the risk, and carry those heavier lashes without putting your own natural lashes in danger. However, your decision could lead to too much stress being placed upon those natural lashes \u2013 which could cause them to fall out or suffer damage.<\/p>\n<p>At Ebenezer Eyelash, our lash technicians are experienced, New-York licensed professionals who always offer such recommendations based on their assessment of a client\u2019s best interests. Our goal is always to provide you with the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ebenezereyelash.com\/eyelash-extension-services\/\">best eyelash extensions in New York City<\/a>, and to protect and preserve your natural lashes.
