After all, eyelash extensions are a major commitment for most women, and we all expect every application to be as perfect as can be. Unfortunately, the sad reality is that perfection is often in the eye of the beholder and lash customers are sometimes unhappy with their results. The problem is that you deserve to be satisfied with your new lash extensions. Fortunately, you can increase your odds of a satisfactory experience by finding the right lash artist for your needs.<\/p>\n<h2>Do Your Homework!<\/h2>\n<p>Before you schedule an appointment at any salon, take the time to do a little research. Review the salon\u2019s website to ensure that you understand the services that they offer and check out reviews online. Remember, your goal is to find a lash artist and salon that you can rely on over time, since your new extensions will need to be refilled and renewed periodically. So, make sure that you are comfortable with the business you choose, since you will likely want to continue to use the same services in the months and years to come.<\/p>\n<h2>Understand Why People Might be Dissatisfied<\/h2>\n<p>It\u2019s also important to understand why some customers are dissatisfied with the services they get. With lash extensions, there are typically only a few main reasons for a customer to be unhappy:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The customer experiences irritation around the eye after the experience \u2013 which generally only occurs if there is an intolerance or allergy in play. Trained lash artists try to rule out that possibility prior to the application.<\/li>\n<li>The lashes fall out over the next few days. Usually, this is due to a failure to follow aftercare instructions, but it could also be a poor application.<\/li>\n<li>The lash artist is unskilled and did not apply the extensions correctly \u2013 leaving the customer with less than perfect lashes and a real reason to complain!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>What to Look for in a Lash Artist and Salon<\/h2>\n<p>To find the right lash artist, you need to know what you\u2019re looking for. Here are the key things to consider during your research efforts:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Does the salon hire only trained and experienced lash artists? Does the business allow you the freedom to select which artist will apply your extensions?<\/li>\n<li>Are the salon\u2019s lash artists licensed? That licensing is important, since it signifies that the person applying your extensions has the right training and skills to handle the job.<\/li>\n<li>If there are negative reviews, does the salon respond with respect and a real desire to satisfy the customer\u2019s needs? Look, every business gets bad reviews every now and then because you can\u2019t always satisfy everyone you serve. The important thing is how they handle those reviews!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In short, don\u2019t settle for anything less than the best when it comes to selecting your lash artist. Find a salon that is staffed by trained, licensed <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ebenezereyelash.com\/eyelash-extension-services\/\">eyelash extension specialists<\/a> and verify that management is committed to customer satisfaction. That will provide the best guarantee possible that you\u2019ll love your lash extension experience.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>There are few things more disappointing than an unsatisfactory experience at the lash salon.
