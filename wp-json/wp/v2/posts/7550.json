Unfortunately, there\u2019s so much conflicting information out in the public square that it can be difficult to distinguish between fact and myth. For example, have you wondered whether your lashes need a break from extensions from time to time? Some so-called experts claim that your lashes will be ruined if you wear extensions year-round. Others claim that there\u2019s no such risk. What\u2019s the real story? We have the answers you\u2019re looking for!<\/p>\n<h2>The Theory: Giving Your Lashes a Break<\/h2>\n<p>For those who subscribe to the notion that your lashes need a break every now and again, the reasoning is simple. Lash extensions are a beauty enhancement that place stress on your natural lashes. They\u2019re fine to wear for a lash cycle or two, but they\u2019re simply too much for your lashes to handle without a rest period between those cycles.<\/p>\n<p>Now, there\u2019s something to that theory, obviously \u2013 as there is plenty of anecdotal evidence to suggest that some lash-wearers do experience more lash loss when they wear extensions month after month. Some experience irritation after several consecutive extension applications. At the same time, though, the evidence also suggests that most lash-wearers never experience those types of concerns.<\/p>\n<h2>Reasons for Taking a Break<\/h2>\n<p>So, let\u2019s say that you\u2019re one of the many millions of women who hasn\u2019t experienced lash loss or irritation due to repeated extension wear. Are there other reasons that might make it a good idea for you to give your lashes a rest every now and then? As it turns out, there are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you know that you\u2019re not as committed to your lash cleansing routine as you should be, it might be a good idea to take a break \u2013 at least until you get into the habit of cleaning them daily. Neglect in that area can lead to irritation, infection, and other problems.<\/li>\n<li>Are you a lash-picker? If you can\u2019t keep your fingers away from your lashes throughout the day, chances are that your natural lashes are not as healthy as they should be. Take a rest so that they can grow back stronger and provide better support for those extensions.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If, on the other hand, you have no lash loss or irritation problems, regularly cleanse and care for your lashes and extensions, and aren\u2019t in the habit of pulling on them regularly, then you probably don\u2019t need to worry about giving those natural lashes a break.<\/p>\n<p>At Ebenezer Eyelash, we always want you to have the long, beautiful, and healthy lashes every woman deserves.
